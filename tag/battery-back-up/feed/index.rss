								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years our MS-Series solar generators have led the industry in design and engineering.  One feature that has set these units apart is the ability for the user to adjust the solar racking system to maximize solar gain throughout the year.  Well that feature just got better.  With the release of our Extreme Latitude system, users can now adjust their winter setting all up to 50-degrees.<br />
This allows folks in extreme northern (and southern) latitudes to maximize their solar harvest during winter months – when sun’s path across the sky is lower.  The steep angle also allows enhances the unit’s ability to shed snow.  So whether you’re in Alberta (or New Zealand) rest assured that your MS-Series unit will be efficient and safe – even when the days are short and the weather is stormy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile Solar would like to applaud the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for its decision to green light battery-based grid-connected photovoltaic systems.&nbsp; Utilities such as PG&amp;E had been pushing for huge fees and a burdensome regulatory process in order to dissuade homeowners from storing energy in batteries in conjunction with their roof-top solar electric systems.&nbsp; Well the CPUC has stood up and told those self-serving utilities to “sit down!”&nbsp; Hats off to you, CPUC!!!</p>

<h5>California to Utilities: Connect Battery-Solar Systems to the Grid<br />
UPDATE: SolarCity resumes applications as California regulators clear way for net-metered solar-battery systems</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff St. John  April 16, 2014<br />
California regulators have just issued a rebuke to utilities, and a thumbs-up to customers and companies that want to connect hundreds of now-stalled battery-backed solar PV projects across the state.<br />
On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision that would exempt most storage-solar projects from extra utility fees and interconnection studies (PDF). Instead, it would require utilities to treat them as regular old net-metered solar systems, as long as they meet certain requirements.</p>
