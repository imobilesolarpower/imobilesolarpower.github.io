								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile Solar would like to applaud the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for its decision to green light battery-based grid-connected photovoltaic systems.&nbsp; Utilities such as PG&amp;E had been pushing for huge fees and a burdensome regulatory process in order to dissuade homeowners from storing energy in batteries in conjunction with their roof-top solar electric systems.&nbsp; Well the CPUC has stood up and told those self-serving utilities to “sit down!”&nbsp; Hats off to you, CPUC!!!</p>

<h5>California to Utilities: Connect Battery-Solar Systems to the Grid<br />
UPDATE: SolarCity resumes applications as California regulators clear way for net-metered solar-battery systems</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff St. John  April 16, 2014<br />
California regulators have just issued a rebuke to utilities, and a thumbs-up to customers and companies that want to connect hundreds of now-stalled battery-backed solar PV projects across the state.<br />
On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision that would exempt most storage-solar projects from extra utility fees and interconnection studies (PDF). Instead, it would require utilities to treat them as regular old net-metered solar systems, as long as they meet certain requirements.</p>
