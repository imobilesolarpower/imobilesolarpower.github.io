								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exactly 10 years ago, Mobile Solar created its first trailer-based solar generator. Coupling solar panels and batteries was a very novel concept at the time and as the years went on we became increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of a future in which the sun could provide us with energy at all hours of the day. The success of our units have proven the utility of such a system but we realize that we can only do so much with our transportable units that cater to a small and largely to off-grid clientele.<br />
For years we have waited for GE, Edison or some major utility to offer a large scale renewable energy storage solution. Yesterday such a solution was brought to the mainstream by Elon Musk’s Tesla, one of the most forward thinking companies on the planet.  Tesla’s new battery systems, the Powerwall and the Powerpack will be tremendously crucial to our renewable energy powered future. Excess solar power produced during the day can now be stored for later use in an economical way like never before.<br />
We look forward to a solar powered future and the possibility of using Tesla’s new batteries in our future units.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile Solar would like to applaud the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for its decision to green light battery-based grid-connected photovoltaic systems.&nbsp; Utilities such as PG&amp;E had been pushing for huge fees and a burdensome regulatory process in order to dissuade homeowners from storing energy in batteries in conjunction with their roof-top solar electric systems.&nbsp; Well the CPUC has stood up and told those self-serving utilities to “sit down!”&nbsp; Hats off to you, CPUC!!!</p>

<h5>California to Utilities: Connect Battery-Solar Systems to the Grid<br />
UPDATE: SolarCity resumes applications as California regulators clear way for net-metered solar-battery systems</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff St. John  April 16, 2014<br />
California regulators have just issued a rebuke to utilities, and a thumbs-up to customers and companies that want to connect hundreds of now-stalled battery-backed solar PV projects across the state.<br />
On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision that would exempt most storage-solar projects from extra utility fees and interconnection studies (PDF). Instead, it would require utilities to treat them as regular old net-metered solar systems, as long as they meet certain requirements.</p>

<h2>Solar Generators: Clean, Portable Power</h2>
<p>11/20/2012 12:01:50 PM</p>
<p>By <a title="Miriam Landman" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/miriam-landman-bio.aspx">Miriam Landman</a></p>

<p>Generators are typically used to provide electricity during power outages (e.g., during storms, emergencies, and related disaster-relief operations) or in off-grid situations or areas where there is no access to a built-in power source (e.g., on construction sites, on camping trips, or at outdoor events—for concert stages, food booths, etc.). So, in a nutshell, they’re mostly used for temporary, portable/mobile, back-up, or remote power needs. Generators are especially critical for some farms, to keep well pumps running (during power outages) to be able to continue to get water to livestock or crops.</p>
<p>Conventional generators have a number of downsides. They require gasoline (or diesel fuel), which can be expensive — especially during emergencies, when there can also be gas shortages. The emissions from gas-powered generators also contribute to air pollution and climate change, and they can cause carbon monoxide poisoning when placed inside a home or building, or too close to doors, windows, or vents on the outside of a building. Furthermore, gas generators are very loud.</p>
