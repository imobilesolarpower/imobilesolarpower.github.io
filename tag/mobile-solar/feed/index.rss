								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To determine recharge time from the solar panels, just divide the utilized battery capacity (in kWh) by the daily solar harvest (in kWh/day).  For instance, the MS-225 has a battery capacity of 25kWh and solar array has a daily harvest of 9kWh/day.  Let’s assume you drain the battery down 80% (meaning 20% is left in the battery).  The math: 25kWh x 0.80 = 20kWh.  And 20kWh / 9kWh/day = 2.2 days of solar charge to bring the battery back up to a 100% State of Charge (SOC).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exactly 10 years ago, Mobile Solar created its first trailer-based solar generator. Coupling solar panels and batteries was a very novel concept at the time and as the years went on we became increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of a future in which the sun could provide us with energy at all hours of the day. The success of our units have proven the utility of such a system but we realize that we can only do so much with our transportable units that cater to a small and largely to off-grid clientele.<br />
For years we have waited for GE, Edison or some major utility to offer a large scale renewable energy storage solution. Yesterday such a solution was brought to the mainstream by Elon Musk’s Tesla, one of the most forward thinking companies on the planet.  Tesla’s new battery systems, the Powerwall and the Powerpack will be tremendously crucial to our renewable energy powered future. Excess solar power produced during the day can now be stored for later use in an economical way like never before.<br />
We look forward to a solar powered future and the possibility of using Tesla’s new batteries in our future units.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years our MS-Series solar generators have led the industry in design and engineering.  One feature that has set these units apart is the ability for the user to adjust the solar racking system to maximize solar gain throughout the year.  Well that feature just got better.  With the release of our Extreme Latitude system, users can now adjust their winter setting all up to 50-degrees.<br />
This allows folks in extreme northern (and southern) latitudes to maximize their solar harvest during winter months – when sun’s path across the sky is lower.  The steep angle also allows enhances the unit’s ability to shed snow.  So whether you’re in Alberta (or New Zealand) rest assured that your MS-Series unit will be efficient and safe – even when the days are short and the weather is stormy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile Solar would like to applaud the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for its decision to green light battery-based grid-connected photovoltaic systems.&nbsp; Utilities such as PG&amp;E had been pushing for huge fees and a burdensome regulatory process in order to dissuade homeowners from storing energy in batteries in conjunction with their roof-top solar electric systems.&nbsp; Well the CPUC has stood up and told those self-serving utilities to “sit down!”&nbsp; Hats off to you, CPUC!!!</p>

<h5>California to Utilities: Connect Battery-Solar Systems to the Grid<br />
UPDATE: SolarCity resumes applications as California regulators clear way for net-metered solar-battery systems</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff St. John  April 16, 2014<br />
California regulators have just issued a rebuke to utilities, and a thumbs-up to customers and companies that want to connect hundreds of now-stalled battery-backed solar PV projects across the state.<br />
On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a proposed decision that would exempt most storage-solar projects from extra utility fees and interconnection studies (PDF). Instead, it would require utilities to treat them as regular old net-metered solar systems, as long as they meet certain requirements.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> &#8220;Paso Robles, California is a populated urban area with an abundance of solar exposure and limited building space. Due to an unreliable utility grid producing frequent service outages, the community sought an alternative energy solution to offset utility grid dependency and take advantage of California’s lucrative net-metering opportunities. A grid-tied system would exceed spacing restraints and disconnect from the grid during utility outages— an all-too-frequent occurrence. With these limitations in mind, it was clear that this project required a more advanced system with a small footprint.Working within project constraints, Mobile Solar designed a PV system with 418Ah/48V battery backup storage housed in a custom-built structure behind the condominium. The state-of-the-art system includes an OutBack FLEXpower TWO pre-wired system to maintain the backup batteries at a full state of charge and supply power to the OutBack inverters, allowing the resident to sell excess electricity back to the grid for additional financial incentives. Using this net-metering program, the condominium owner now has the potential to completely eliminate costly utility bills.&#8221;</p>
